# BugSite

### What works so far

Only tested thing is the GET and POST methods. It is possible to post single objects, but not yet a JSON array of things. But GET works properly, and the website can fetch the info from the API without problems so far. 

### Things left to do

Make a properly functioning POST method to allow POSTing of a full darn array of things, not just a single object.

Make the whole thing persistence. So far, my idea is to add JDBC persistence. Idk yet how I'm gonna do this, but I will. 

Security. Make the whole API secure.
